Kong Path-Based Routing
Copyright 2018 bogas04 

Project Description:
====================

The Kong User Agent Based Routing Plugin is a small, lua-based, Openrestly module which allows for setting the Upstream Hostname of a proxy request to a dynamic value, based on the URI parameters. This plugin is required for API Gateways to integrate with certain deployment patterns, such as the one we see with myUHC. It can be a little niche, but we value the community feedback on our design, and believe that others could benefit from our work.
